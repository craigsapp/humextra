======================================================

This directory contains the source code for programs in the set 
of Humdrum programs which are compiled from C++ programs.
Compiled versions of these programs for various operating systems
are available with documentation from the website:
   http://extras.humdrum.org

To compile the Humdrum Extra programs found in this directory
structure, type the following commands:
   cd humextra		# if not already in the humextra base directory
   make

To compile only a single program, such as barnum, you would
type the following commands:
   make library
   make barnum

If you write your own programs, you can place them in the
directory humextra/cli and then compile them in
a manner similar to compiling single programs described above.

Compiled programs are written to the humextra/bin directory.
